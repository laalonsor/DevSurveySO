# Developers Survey Stack Overflow


This project is part of the UDACITY NANODEGREE program. 
Current project requires the creation of a blog post for data science, and the base to build such blog are related to the Developers Survey from Stack Overflow.

Original data sources can be found here:

In this project I will identify different variables that are related to the job satisfaction reported within the developers survey of Stack Overflow. Some of these variables are related to the size of the company, and working habits of the developers (such as the preferred time to start working) and also I will explore the relevance of having difficulty communicating ideas with the salary of the developers.

This project is handling a ataset containing quite sensitive information (e.g. compensation level, communication skills, working habits of each individual) and as such it is important to keep in mind that all these responses are "declared" and not "measured", which intrinsically may drive to conclusions containing a bias on how each developer wants to be perceived / judged for those using the information.
