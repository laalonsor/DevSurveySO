# Developers Survey Stack Overflow


This project is part of the UDACITY NANODEGREE program. 
Current project requires the creation of a blog post for data science, and the base to build such blog are related to the Developers Survey from Stack Overflow.

Original data sources can be found here:

In this project I will identify different variables that are related to the job satisfaction reported within the developers survey of Stack Overflow. Some of these variables are related to the size of the company, and working habits of the developers (such as the preferred time to start working) and also I will explore the relevance of having difficulty communicating ideas with the salary of the developers.

It is a subject of interest to explore the relation of compensation with a capability as basic as "communication skills", which in any field, not only in IT developing code, is a basic characteristic of those who are able to progress and achieve higer levels of rewards. It is also interesting to analize how easy is to collaborate with developers whose preferred working hours are not "normal", therefore their connection with the rest of the organization from which they belong, either as consultants or as part of a developers team.
