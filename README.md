# Developers Survey Stack Overflow


This project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree program, and as such it requires the creation of a blog post for data science, and the base to build it is related to the Developers Survey from Stack Overflow.

Original data sources can be found here, in this project I will be using the responses from 2018:
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

In this project I will identify different variables that are related to the job satisfaction reported within the developers survey of Stack Overflow. Some of these variables are related to the size of the company, and working habits of the developers (such as the preferred time to start working) and also I will explore the relevance of having difficulty communicating ideas with the salary of the developers.

Having said this, it is a subject of interest to explore the relation of job satisfaction with a capability as basic as "communication skills", which in any field, not only IT, is a basic characteristic of those who are able to progress. It is also interesting to analize the job satisfaction whose close social nucleus is influenced by other developers, engineers or scientists, as a way to understand if the job satisfaction is reinforced by the social interaction outside work.

The analysis is complemented with other variables that measure how the job satisfaction is influenced by the technical decisions that are made ("My opininons seem to count"). This analysis will be based in the relation between job satisfaction and the fields: InfluenceHardware, InfluenceServers, InfluenceTechStack, InfluenceDeptTech, InfluenceVizTools, InfluenceDatabase, InfluenceCloud, InfluenceConsultants and InfluenceRecruitment.
